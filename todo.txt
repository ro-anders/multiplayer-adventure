To Do
-----
- Win screen showing castle will only show two objects and often randomly displays the other players even if they weren't there to start
- Hold a key beneath you and just step into a castle.  Key appears at top of outside of castle.  Should appear right below gate (when gate is open)
- Going right of Robinett room puts you in the main hall center - should be behind the bar of main hall left
- Moving into a room that is immediately blocked by a wall should flicker and, when you stop moving kick you back to the previous room

To Check
--------
- Bridge placement looked slightly off to other player
- Looked like other player wasn't carrying an object when he was - seen this several times
- Green dragon ate player 1.  Player 2 reset and now didn't see green dragon.
- Right arrow key seemed to get stuck.
- Too often unlock and enter castle and leave the gate locked behind you.  Seems to be repeatable if a third object in the castle room.
  Reproduced once.  Player entered a castle with key behind him.  Looks like everything went well in his world, key never touched the gate and 
  gate never changed state.  On the other player the key touched the gate and the gate started to close but no event was sent since 
  other player was not in the same room.  When first player entered castle gate was not forced open because in other world they don't enter
  castles but instead just sent a player move event that they are now in the castle.
  Attempted to fix by having game move all players to the inside of the castle without waiting for a move event.  See if that worked.

Original Disparities
--------------------
- Win screen only shows two objects in room
- Objects aren't occluded by the wall in the catacombs
- Ball doesn't make pyramid as it drags along the bottom wall
- If a dragon bites and you then leave the room, the dragon should continue along the direction it was heading before it bit you.  Right now it just stays still.
- Chalice touch gate doesn't trigger win
  (work around in mine wins, but doesn't have same behavior where too many objects in room obscures touch)
- Can't escape dragon by running left 
  (work around in mine allows left but then doesn't allow up and right)
- Bat sometimes gets stuck picking up object (fixed in mine & original branch)
