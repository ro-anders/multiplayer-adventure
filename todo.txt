To Do
-----
- Too often unlock and enter castle and leave the gate locked behind you.  Seems to be repeatable if a third object in the castle room.
  Reproduced once.  Player entered a castle with key behind him.  Looks like everything went well in his world, key never touched the gate and 
  gate never changed state.  On the other player the key touched the gate and the gate started to close but no event was sent since 
  other player was not in the same room.  When first player entered castle gate was not forced open because in other world they don't enter
  castles but instead just sent a player move event that they are now in the castle.  Think there needs to be a "player entered castle" event sent.
- Win screen showing castle will only show two objects and often randomly displays the other players even if they weren't there to start
- Hold a key beneath you and just step into a castle.  Key appears at top of outside of castle.

To Check
--------
- Bridge placement looked slightly off to other player
- Looked like other player wasn't carrying an object when he was
- Green dragon ate player 1.  Player 2 reset and now didn't see green dragon.
- Right arrow key seemed to get stuck.

Original Disparities
--------------------
- Win screen only shows two objects in room
- Objects aren't occluded by the wall in the catacombs
- Ball doesn't make pyramid as it drags along the bottom wall
- Chalice touch gate doesn't trigger win
  (work around in mine wins, but doesn't have same behavior where too many objects in room obscures touch)
- Can't escape dragon by running left 
  (work around in mine allows left but then doesn't allow up and right)
- Bat sometimes gets stuck picking up object (fixed in mine & original branch)
