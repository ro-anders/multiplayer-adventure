To Do
-----
- Player (and waiting for names) should be restricted to 20 characters ASCII with no commas
- Need to detect whether in DEBUG or RELEASE state and not send so much to the log in RELEASE state
- Windows status message flickers.  Shouldn't redraw the whole window.
- Close button on Mac is ineffective.
- 4 requests at once confuses broker.
- Two players connect.  Game ends.  Player from same host connects and is joined with previous game.
- Mac still has menu options that apply to Hirschberg version, not H2H version
- PC cannot use DNS name for broker.  Needs explicit IP address.
- When player holds an object, other players see it held in a different position
- When holding bat at top of screen it switched objects and dropped the object at the top of the above screen.
  Also when it picked up an object that was at the bottom edge of the above screen it dropped its current object pretty low in this screen.
- Dragon getting killed is heard everywhere in the game.  All other sounds mute as they get further away.
- FIXED - Pings not being sent,  If player doesn't move it says they are disconnected.
- FIXED - Mac runs too slow in full screen mode.  Speed up or disable full screen mode.
- FIXED - When castle is locked objects are still wrapped from bottom of entrance room to opening of castle
- FIXED - Make key controls the same for Mac and PC
- FIXED - Grab an object with someone else in the room and other person picks it up
- FIXED - Hold a key beneath you and just step into a castle.  Key appears at top of outside of castle.  Should appear right below gate (when gate is open)
- FIXED - Win screen often randomly displays the other players even if they weren't there to start
- FIXED - Seems to be some fatal exception on exiting.  Not critical since we're exiting, but a little disturbing.
- FIXED - Sometimes when you unlock and enter castle the gate locks behind you.  Has to do with other machines seeing player touch the key to the castle
          and sending a lock event.  Unlock a castle.  Hold the key above you and touch the open gate.  As it closes it will bring you into the castle.
          Other players will see the castle open, but you will see the castle closed.
- FIXED - Crash on Mac when playing across internet - Looked like first round of game executing before setup was done.  
          Put in explicit wait until setup is done.
- FIXED - Tab order in Windows is wrong.
- FIXED - Dragon's pre-bite direction not properly synced across players (would be good to have bite and die events carry a previous direction)

To Check
--------
- Something happened with red dragon that suddenly ball could move through walls.  Couldn't immediately reproduce. - 3/24/17
- Looked like other player wasn't carrying an object when he was - seen this several times
- Green dragon ate player 1.  Player 2 reset and now didn't see green dragon.
- Right arrow key seemed to get stuck.

Original Disparities
--------------------
- Win screen only shows two objects in room
- Objects aren't occluded by the wall in the catacombs
- HACKED - Chalice touch gate doesn't trigger win
  (work around in mine wins, but doesn't have same behavior where too many objects in room obscures touch)
- HACKED - Can't escape dragon by running left 
  (work around in mine allows left but then doesn't allow up and right)
- FIXED - Peeking into other room should show flickering ball on both sides of room, right now shows only on one side
- FIXED - Peeking up or down into a room with dragons should cause the dragons to chase you.
- FIXED - If you run diagonally into the point of a corner you can get stuck on the corner.  Original behavior is you always go the vertical direction.
- FIXED - Ball doesn't make pyramid as it drags along the bottom wall
- FIXED - An unheld object (including bats and dragons) that touches an open gate while someone is watching should go into the castle - but it doesn't. 
- FIXED - If a dragon bites and you then leave the room, the dragon should continue along the direction it was heading before it bit you.  Right now it just stays still.
- FIXED - Bat sometimes gets stuck picking up object
- FIXED - Moving into a room that is immediately blocked by a wall should cause you to flicker and, when you stop moving kick you back to the previous room
- FIXED - Going right of Robinett room puts you in the main hall center - should be behind the bar of main hall left
