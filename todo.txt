To Do
-----
- Should not win unless you are holding the chalice.
- Too often unlock and enter castle and leave the gate locked behind you.  Seems to be repeatable if a third object in the castle room.
  Reproduced once.  Player entered a castle with key behind him.  Looks like everything went well in his world, key never touched the gate and 
  gate never changed state.  On the other player the key touched the gate and the gate started to close but no event was sent since 
  other player was not in the same room.  When other player entered castle gate was not forced open because other players don't enter
  castles they bump against the wall until an event comes in that they've entered (I think)
- Hold a key beneath you and just step into a castle.  Key appears at top of outside of castle.

To Check
--------
- Bridge placement looked slightly off to other player
- Looked like other player wasn't carrying an object when he was
- Green dragon ate player 1.  Player 2 reset and now didn't see green dragon.
- Right arrow key seemed to get stuck.
