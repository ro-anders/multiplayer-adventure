To Do
-----
- Sometimes when you unlock and enter castle the gate locks behind you.  Has to do with other machines seeing player touch the key to the castle and sending a lock event.
- Grab an object with someone else in the room and other person picks it up
  Start Game 1 and have player 2 go to gold castle and grab gold key.  On player 1's game, player 2 gets key.  On player 2's game, player 1 get's key.
- Hold a key beneath you and just step into a castle.  Key appears at top of outside of castle.  Should appear right below gate (when gate is open)
- FIXED - When player holds an object, other players see it held in a different position
- FIXED - Win screen often randomly displays the other players even if they weren't there to start

To Check
--------
- Dragon's pre-bite direction not properly synced across players (would be good to have bite and die events carry a previous direction)
- Looked like other player wasn't carrying an object when he was - seen this several times
- Green dragon ate player 1.  Player 2 reset and now didn't see green dragon.
- Right arrow key seemed to get stuck.

Original Disparities
--------------------
- Win screen only shows two objects in room
- Objects aren't occluded by the wall in the catacombs
- Ball doesn't make pyramid as it drags along the bottom wall
- Peeking into other room should show flickering ball on both sides of room, right now shows only on one side
- Peeking up or down into a room with dragons should cause the dragons to chase you.
- HACKED - Chalice touch gate doesn't trigger win
  (work around in mine wins, but doesn't have same behavior where too many objects in room obscures touch)
- HACKED - Can't escape dragon by running left 
  (work around in mine allows left but then doesn't allow up and right)
- FIXED - If a dragon bites and you then leave the room, the dragon should continue along the direction it was heading before it bit you.  Right now it just stays still.
- FIXED - Bat sometimes gets stuck picking up object
- FIXED - Moving into a room that is immediately blocked by a wall should cause you to flicker and, when you stop moving kick you back to the previous room
- FIXED - Going right of Robinett room puts you in the main hall center - should be behind the bar of main hall left
