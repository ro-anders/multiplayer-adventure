To Do
-----
- Should not win unless you are holding the chalice.
- If, when dragon bites it touches another player, should bite the other player
- Sending PlayerPickup message when you touch what bat is holding, even though you don't pick it up

To Check
--------
- Bridge placement looked slightly off to other player
- Looked like I plucked the chalice from the bat
- Looked like other player wasn't carrying an object when he was
